    <h3>A tool to take screenshots using your Linux terminal</h3>
</div>

<br><br>
## ANNOUNCEMENT:
**I've decided to shutdown Windows compatibility, reason is, this tool is terminal friendly and Windows users usually don't, other user friendly tools are used, like the Windows 10 builtin "Win + Shift + S" command. The linux support will continue and I want to embrace Unix like OSs, hope you all understand me.**

&nbsp;
## ‚ùóÔ∏è Install:
Arch based:
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/ghost-git.git
